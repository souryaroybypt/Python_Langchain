Wrestling is an ancient combat sport involving grappling techniques to gain a position of advantage over an opponent. It encompasses a wide variety of styles, with Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling being the two disciplines featured in the Olympic Games. In Greco-Roman, holds below the waist are forbidden, emphasizing throws and upper body strength. Freestyle wrestling, however, permits leg attacks and is considered a more open style. Wrestlers aim to score points through takedowns, reversals, or pinning their opponent's shoulders to the mat for a pinfall victory. Collegiate or folkstyle wrestling, popular in the United States, focuses on control and earning points for holds and takedowns. Beyond competitive sport, professional wrestling exists as a form of sports entertainment, where the outcomes are predetermined to create a theatrical spectacle.
