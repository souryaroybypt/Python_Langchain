It is played between two teams of eleven players on a field with a 22-yard pitch at its center. The objective is simple: the batting team scores runs while the fielding team tries to get them out. Various formats exist, from the traditional, multi-day Test matches to the fast-paced, twenty-over T20s. More than just a sport, cricket is a cultural phenomenon that inspires teamwork, patience, and unwavering sportsmanship among its passionate fans
