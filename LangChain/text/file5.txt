Chariot racing was one of the most popular and thrilling sports in ancient Greece, Rome, and the Byzantine Empire. In Rome, chariot races occurred in large stadiums called circuses, the most famous being the Circus Maximus, which could seat up to 150,000 spectators. Typically, teams of two- or four-horse chariots, driven by a single charioteer, would race seven laps around an oval track divided by a central barrier (spina). Charioteers were often slaves or freedmen who could gain immense wealth and celebrity if victorious, even though their social status remained low. Races were dangerous, with crashes (naufragia) occurring frequently at the sharp turns (metae). Despite the risks, the speed, skill, and violence of chariot racing captivated audiences and were integral to ancient Roman public entertainment and culture
