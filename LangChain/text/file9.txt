Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that focuses on creating machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. This technology enables computers to learn, reason, solve problems, perceive, and make decisions autonomously. AI systems achieve this by processing vast amounts of data, identifying patterns, and using those patterns to accomplish specific goals.
