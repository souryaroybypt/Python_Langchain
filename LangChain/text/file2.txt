Football, or soccer, is the world's most popular sport, captivating millions across the globe. Played by two teams of eleven players, the game involves maneuvering a spherical ball into the opponent's goal, primarily using feet, head, and chest, but not hands (except for goalkeepers within their designated area). Matches typically last 90 minutes, split into two halves. The team scoring more goals wins, while an equal score results in a draw or proceeds to extra time or a penalty shootout in knockout competitions. The sport's allure lies in its simplicity, requiring minimal equipment, and its promotion of teamwork, strategy, discipline, and physical fitness.
