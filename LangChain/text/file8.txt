Rugby, also known as rugby football, is a full-contact team sport with two main codes: rugby union and rugby league. It originated at Rugby School in England in the early 19th century. The game involves two teams attempting to score points by carrying an oval-shaped ball across the opponent's goal line for a "try," or by kicking it through H-shaped goalposts.
