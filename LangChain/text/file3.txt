Hockey is a family of stick-and-ball or stick-and-puck games with two popular variants: field hockey and ice hockey. Ice hockey, Canada's national winter sport, is played on an ice rink where skaters use sticks to propel a vulcanized rubber puck into the opposing team's net. It is a fast-paced and physical sport, with teams of six players vying for the Stanley Cup in the NHL or Olympic gold. Field hockey, popular in India and Europe, is played with a ball on a grass or artificial turf field. Both versions emphasize speed, skill, strategy, and teamwork, captivating fans with their intense gameplay.
