Gladiators were professional fighters in ancient Rome who battled one another, wild animals, and condemned criminals for public entertainment. Initially part of funeral rites to honor deceased aristocrats, the contests evolved into a massive, bloodthirsty spectacle held in amphitheaters like the Colosseum. Gladiators were typically slaves, prisoners of war, or condemned criminals, but some free citizens also volunteered for the prospect of fame and fortune. They trained at special schools known as ludi, where they mastered various fighting styles and weapons.
