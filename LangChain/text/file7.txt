An aircraft carrier is a massive naval warship that functions as a mobile airbase at sea, allowing a nation to project airpower anywhere in the world. These complex, self-contained vessels feature a full-length flight deck for launching and recovering aircraft, along with hangar facilities for storage and maintenance. Modern supercarriers, often powered by nuclear reactors for extended range, can carry a wide array of aircraft, including fighter jets, surveillance planes, and helicopters. They are the centerpiece of a larger carrier strike group, escorted by other warships for protection. First developed in the early 20th century, aircraft carriers replaced battleships as the dominant combat vessel in naval warfare after World War II
